<string name="about_us">
    This application is made to simulate the Cryptography algorithms.
    Algorithms used are RSA, Base64, DES.

    In this application,
    RSA algorithm is implemented as an encryption method using mathematical formula, which derives Public and Private Keys.
    Base64 is implemented as an Image Encryption method, where image is encrypted into string.
    DES algorithm shows the encryption and Decryption of String messages using a common public key.
